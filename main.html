        waste disposal, the collection, processing, and recycling or deposition of the waste materials of human society. Waste is classified by source and composition. Broadly speaking, waste materials are either liquid or solid in form, and their components may be either hazardous or inert in their effects on health and the environment. The term waste is typically applied to solid waste, sewage (wastewater), hazardous waste, and electronic waste.

        In industrialized countries, municipal liquid waste is funneled through sewage systems, where it undergoes wastewater treatment, or sewage treatment. This process removes most or all of the impurities from wastewater, or sewage, before they can reach groundwater aquifers or surface waters such as rivers, lakes, estuaries, and oceans. (For more information on sewage systems and treatment, see wastewater treatment.</p>
